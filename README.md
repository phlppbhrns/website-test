# deepl-groceries-app

This is a repo for my current project, i.e. an app for tracking bought groceries and their expiring dates automatically using neural network and computer vision techniques.

# Idea

The idea is to keep track of what I bought and what expires next by taking a picture of the groceries bill and analysing it with neural networks. Using a database with deposited expiring dates (and maybe even recipe ideas), the app will autmatically update a list which tells you what needs to be eaten next.

# Features I would like to include

- Camera button for taking a picture of grocery bills
- Button for uploading digital bills
- Two tabs:
  - List with groceries that need to be eaten next (time-ordered, maybe even colored red to green)
  - Suggestions for recipes based on the groceries that I have at home
